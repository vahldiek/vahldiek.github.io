Process-based isolation is the de facto isolation used in practice, e.g., web browsers. However, it incurs significant performance overhead and is typically infeasible when frequent switches between isolation domains are expected. To address this problem, many intra-process memory isolation techniques have been proposed using novel kernel abstractions, recent CPU extensions, such as Intel® MPK, and software-based fault isolation (e.g., WebAssembly). However, these techniques insufficiently isolate kernel resources, such as file descriptors, or do so by incurring substantial overheads when these resources are accessed. Other work virtualizes the kernel context inside a privileged user space domain, but this is ad-hoc, error-prone, and provides only a limited set of kernel functionalities. We propose μSWITCH, an efficient kernel context isolation mechanism with memory protection that addresses these limitations. We use a protected structure, shared by the kernel and the userspace, for context switching and propose implicit context switching to improve its performance by deferring the kernel resource switch to the next system call. We apply μSWITCH to isolate libraries in the Firefox web browser and an HTTP server, and reduce the overhead of isolation by 32.7% to 98.4% compared with other isolation techniques.","tags":null,"title":"uSwitch: Fast Kernel Context Isolation with Implicit Context Switches","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anjo Vahldiek-Oberwagner"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1671062400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1671062400,"objectID":"0a44469264758c0671e8a0552bee5b9b","permalink":"https://vahldiek.github.io/publication/vahldiek-2022-darpa/","publishdate":"2022-12-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vahldiek-2022-darpa/","section":"publication","summary":"Motivated by developer productivity, serverless computing, and\r\nmicroservices have become the de facto development model in the cloud.\r\nMicroservices decompose monolithic applications into separate functional units\r\ndeployed individually.

This paper presents Cerberus, a formal approach to secure and efficient enclave memory sharing. To reduce the burden of formal verification, we compare different sharing models and choose a simple yet powerful sharing model. Based on the sharing model, Cerberus extends an enclave platform such that enclave memory can be made immutable and shareable across multiple enclaves via additional operations. We use incremental verification starting with an existing formal model called the Trusted Abstract Platform (TAP). Using our extended TAP model, we formally verify that Cerberus does not break or weaken the security guarantees of the enclaves despite allowing memory sharing. More specifically, we prove the Secure Remote Execution (SRE) property on our formal model.

We present, the Endokernel, a new process model and security architecture that nests an extensible monitor into the standard process for building efficient least-authority abstractions. The Endokernel introduces a new virtual machine abstraction for representing subprocess authority, which is enforced by an efficient self-isolating monitor that maps the abstraction to system level objects (processes, threads, files, and signals). We show how the Endokernel can be used to develop specialized separation abstractions using an exokernel-like organization to provide virtual privilege rings, which we use to reorganize and secure NGINX. Our prototype, includes a new syscall monitor, the nexpoline, and explores the tradeoffs of implementing it with diverse mechanisms, including Intel Control Enhancement Technology.

Examples include protecting cryptographic keys against exploits like OpenSSL's Heartbleed bug or protecting a language runtime from native libraries written in unsafe languages. When runtime references across isolation boundaries occur relatively infrequently, then page-based hardware isolation can be used, because the cost of kernel- or hypervisor-mediated domain switching is tolerable. However, some applications, such as the isolation of cryptographic session keys in network-facing services, require very frequent domain switching. In such applications, the overhead of kernel- or hypervisor-mediated domain switching is prohibitive. In this paper, we present ERIM, a novel technique that provides hardware-enforced isolation with low overhead on x86 CPUs, even at high switching rates (ERIM's measured overhead is less than 1% for 100,000 switches per second). The key idea is to combine protection keys (MPKs), a feature recently added to x86 that allows protection domain switches in userspace, with binary inspection to prevent circumvention. We show that ERIM can be applied with little effort to new and existing applications, doesn't require compiler changes, can run on a stock Linux kernel, and has low runtime overhead even at high domain switching rates.

As a result we need to protect this data against confidentiality and integrity violations that can result in the illicit release, loss, or modification of a user’s and an organization’s sensitive data such as personal media content or client records. Existing techniques protecting confidentiality and integrity lack either efficiency or are vulnerable to malicious attacks. In this thesis we suggest techniques, Guardat and ERIM, to efficiently and robustly protect persistent and in-memory data. To protect the confidentiality and integrity of persistent data, clients specify per-file policies to Guardat declaratively, concisely and separately from code. Guardat enforces policies by mediating I/O in the storage layer. In contrast to prior techniques, we protect against accidental or malicious circumvention of higher software layers. We present the design and prototype implementation, and demonstrate that Guardat efficiently enforces example policies in a web server. To protect the confidentiality and integrity of in-memory data, ERIM isolates sensitive data using Intel Memory Protection Keys (MPK), a recent x86 extension to partition the address space. However, MPK does not protect against malicious attacks by itself. We prevent malicious attacks by combining MPK with call gates to trusted entry points and ahead-of-time binary inspection. In contrast to existing techniques, ERIM efficiently protects frequently-used session keys of web servers, an in-memory reference monitor’s private state, and managed runtimes from native libraries. These use cases result in high switch rates of the order of 10^5 - 10^6 switches/s.

Pesos allows clients to specify per-object security\r\npolicies, concisely and separately from the storage stack, and\r\nenforces these policies by securely mediating the I/O in the\r\npersistence layer through a single unified enforcement layer.\r\nMore broadly, Pesos exposes a rich set of storage policies\r\nensuring the integrity, confidentiality, and access accounting\r\nfor data storage through a declarative policy language.\r\nPesos enforces these policies on untrusted commodity platforms by leveraging a combination of two trusted computing technologies: Intel SGX for trusted execution environment (TEE) and Kinetic Open Storage for trusted storage. We\r\nhave implemented Pesos as a fully-functional storage system\r\nsupporting many useful end-to-end storage features, and a\r\nrange of effective performance optimizations.

A process may include several lwCs, each with possibly different views of memory, file descriptors, and access capabilities. lwCs can be used to efficiently implement roll-back (process can return to a prior recorded state), isolated address spaces (lwCs within the process may have different views of memory, e.g., isolating sensitive data from network-facing components or isolating differ- ent user sessions), and privilege separation (in-process reference monitors can arbitrate and control access). lwCs can be implemented efficiently: the overhead of a lwC is proportional to the amount of memory exclu- sive to the lwC; switching lwCs is quicker than switching kernel threads within the same process. We describe the lwC abstraction and API, and an implementation of lwCs within the FreeBSD 11.0 kernel. Finally, we present an evaluation of common usage patterns, including fast roll- back, session isolation, sensitive data isolation, and in- process reference monitoring, using Apache, nginx, PHP, and OpenSSL.","tags":["Max Planck Institute for Software Systems","University of Maryland"],"title":"Light-Weight Contexts: An OS Abstraction for Safety and Performance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eslam Elnikety","Aastha Mehta","Anjo Vahldiek-oberwagner","Deepak Garg","Peter Druschel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"3debed590ff91e91279afca1ba079561","permalink":"https://vahldiek.github.io/publication/elnikety-2016/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/elnikety-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"Data retrieval systems process data from many sources, each subject to its own data use policy. Ensuring compli-ance with these policies despite bugs, misconfiguration, or operator error in a large, complex, and fast evolving system is a major challenge. Thoth provides an effi-cient, kernel-level compliance layer for data use policies. Declarative policies are attached to the systems' input and output files, key-value tuples, and network connec-tions, and specify the data's integrity and confidential-ity requirements. Thoth tracks the flow of data through the system, and enforces policy regardless of bugs, mis-configurations, compromises in application code, or ac-tions by unprivileged operators.

Policy enforcement relies only on the integrity of the Guardat controller and any external policy dependencies. The semantic gap between the storage layer enforcement and per-file policies is bridged using cryptographic attestations from Guardat.

Data stored under a lease cannot be written for a pre-determined period. During the lease period, online data is protected from corruption due to security breaches, software errors, or accidental data deletion. Storage leases fill an important gap in the spectrum of data protection options because they combine strong integrity for online data with the ability to eventually reclaim storage. We define the storage lease primitive, show how it can be implemented in storage device firmware, and discuss its applications. A simulation-based evaluation indicates that storage leases have a modest performance cost for most workloads on magnetic disks. Using a small amount of flash memory, this overhead can be reduced to near zero.","tags":null,"title":"Protecting Data Integrity with Storage Leases","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hernán Baró Graf","Holger Hermanns","Juhi Kulshrestha","Jens Peter","Anjo Vahldiek","Aravind Vasudevan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293840000,"objectID":"282e55345bf12f722b9f7d036e1624b8","permalink":"https://vahldiek.github.io/publication/graf-2011-verifiedwireless/","publishdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/graf-2011-verifiedwireless/","section":"publication","summary":"Wireless communication, hard real time requirements and safety criticality do not go together well.
